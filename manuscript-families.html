    Manuscript Families
</header>

<div class="content">
    <p>Manuscript families, or "text-types," are groups of manuscripts that share common textual characteristics and geographical origins. By comparing manuscripts from the same family, scholars can trace the history of textual variations and understand how the New Testament was transmitted in different regions of the early Christian world.</p>
