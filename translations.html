    <h1>The History of Major Bible Translations</h1>
</header>

<div class="content">
    <p>The history of Bible translation is as rich and complex as the manuscripts on which these translations are based. Over the centuries, the Bible has been translated into hundreds of languages, with some translations based on earlier versions or specific manuscript families. The availability of new manuscript discoveries and advances in textual criticism has led to multiple revisions and new translations, each with its own approach to rendering the biblical text for modern readers. This page provides an overview of key Bible translations, their origins, and the manuscript sources they rely on.</p>

    <section class="translation">
        <h2>The Septuagint (3rd-1st Century BCE)</h2>
        <p><strong>When It Was Made:</strong> The <em>Septuagint</em>, often abbreviated as LXX, is the earliest known translation of the Hebrew Bible into Greek. It was translated between the 3rd and 1st centuries BCE in Alexandria, Egypt, primarily for the Jewish community living in the Greek-speaking world.</p>

        <p><strong>Manuscript Sources:</strong> The Septuagint was translated from Hebrew texts that predate the standardized <em>Masoretic Text</em> of the Hebrew Bible, meaning it sometimes differs from the Hebrew Bible used in modern Judaism and Christianity. Portions of the Dead Sea Scrolls have revealed similar Hebrew texts to those used by the translators of the Septuagint.</p>

        <p><strong>Significance:</strong> The Septuagint was highly influential in the early Christian church, particularly in the writings of the New Testament, where many Old Testament quotations come from the Greek translation. It was the Bible for Greek-speaking Jews and early Christians for centuries.</p>

    <section class="translation">
        <h2>The Latin Vulgate (Late 4th Century)</h2>
        <p><strong>When It Was Made:</strong> The <em>Latin Vulgate</em> was translated by Jerome between 382-405 CE at the request of Pope Damasus I, who wanted a standardized Latin Bible for the Western church. Jerome's work was based on the best Hebrew and Greek manuscripts available to him at the time.</p>

        <p><strong>Manuscript Sources:</strong> Jerome translated the Old Testament directly from Hebrew texts, rather than the Septuagint, making his translation more consistent with Jewish scripture. For the New Testament, he relied on older Latin versions as well as Greek manuscripts, likely in the Western and Alexandrian traditions.</p>

        <p><strong>Significance:</strong> The Vulgate became the official Bible of the Western Christian Church and remained the standard for centuries. It heavily influenced medieval scholarship and was the basis for the early English translations of the Bible, such as Wycliffe's Bible. It is still used in some parts of the Roman Catholic Church today.</p>

    <section class="translation">
        <h2>Wycliffe's Bible (1382-1395)</h2>
        <p><strong>When It Was Made:</strong> Wycliffe’s Bible, the first complete English translation of the Bible, was produced by John Wycliffe and his followers in the late 14th century. This translation was a reaction to the increasing desire for the Bible to be accessible in the vernacular, at a time when the Latin Vulgate was still the only officially recognized Bible in the Western church.</p>

        <p><strong>Manuscript Sources:</strong> Wycliffe’s Bible was not translated directly from the original Hebrew or Greek texts but was based on the Latin Vulgate, which was the dominant text in the Western church.</p>

        <p><strong>Significance:</strong> Wycliffe’s Bible was revolutionary in making the Scriptures accessible to English speakers. However, it was controversial and condemned by the Church, leading to significant resistance, including posthumous condemnation of Wycliffe. Nonetheless, it set the stage for later English translations.</p>

    <section class="translation">
        <h2>Tyndale's New Testament (1526)</h2>
        <p><strong>When It Was Made:</strong> William Tyndale’s translation of the New Testament into English was published in 1526. It was the first English Bible to be translated directly from Hebrew and Greek texts, rather than relying on the Latin Vulgate. Tyndale’s goal was to make the Bible accessible to common people.</p>

        <p><strong>Manuscript Sources:</strong> Tyndale’s New Testament was based on the Greek <em>Textus Receptus</em>, compiled by Erasmus, which itself relied primarily on Byzantine Greek manuscripts. For his Old Testament translations, Tyndale used Hebrew manuscripts, though he never completed the entire Old Testament.</p>

        <p><strong>Significance:</strong> Tyndale’s work laid the foundation for nearly every subsequent English Bible translation, including the King James Version. His translation was condemned by the Church, and Tyndale was executed for his efforts in 1536, but his legacy endured through later translations.</p>

    <section class="translation">
        <h2>The King James Version (1611)</h2>
        <p><strong>When It Was Made:</strong> The <em>King James Version (KJV)</em>, also known as the Authorized Version, was commissioned by King James I of England in 1604 and completed in 1611. It was a collaborative effort involving over 50 scholars and translators who sought to create a definitive English Bible for both public and private use.</p>

        <p><strong>Manuscript Sources:</strong> The KJV was based primarily on the <em>Textus Receptus</em> for the New Testament and the <em>Masoretic Text</em> for the Old Testament. It also incorporated readings from earlier English translations, such as Tyndale’s Bible and the Geneva Bible, but largely adhered to the Byzantine textual tradition.</p>

        <p><strong>Significance:</strong> The KJV became the most widely read Bible in the English-speaking world and remains one of the most influential and enduring translations. Its majestic language and literary style have shaped English prose and Christian theology for centuries.</p>

    <section class="translation">
        <h2>The Revised Standard Version (1952)</h2>
        <p><strong>When It Was Made:</strong> The <em>Revised Standard Version (RSV)</em> was published in 1952 as a modern revision of the King James Version. It was intended to be a more accurate translation, taking advantage of modern biblical scholarship and newly discovered manuscripts.</p>

        <p><strong>Manuscript Sources:</strong> Unlike the KJV, the RSV incorporated readings from newly discovered ancient manuscripts, including the Dead Sea Scrolls and earlier Greek manuscripts, particularly those of the <em>Alexandrian text-type</em>. It also used the best available critical editions of the Hebrew and Greek texts, such as the Nestle-Aland Greek New Testament.</p>

        <p><strong>Significance:</strong> The RSV marked a shift toward more critical and ecumenical translations, with a focus on accuracy and readability. It served as the basis for many later translations, including the New Revised Standard Version (NRSV) and the English Standard Version (ESV).</p>

    <section class="translation">
        <h2>The New International Version (1978)</h2>
        <p><strong>When It Was Made:</strong> The <em>New International Version (NIV)</em> was first published in 1978 as a completely new translation, created by an international team of evangelical scholars. The goal of the NIV was to produce a modern, accessible translation for English speakers while remaining faithful to the original texts.</p>

        <p><strong>Manuscript Sources:</strong> The NIV was based on the latest available critical editions of the Greek New Testament (such as the Nestle-Aland) and the Hebrew Old Testament (Biblia Hebraica Stuttgartensia), which reflect both the Alexandrian and Byzantine manuscript traditions. It also drew on the Dead Sea Scrolls and other ancient manuscript discoveries.</p>

        <p><strong>Significance:</strong> The NIV quickly became one of the most popular English translations due to its balance of readability and fidelity to the original texts. It is widely used in evangelical circles and continues to be a significant translation in both private reading and public worship.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="translation">
        <h2>The New Revised Standard Version (1989)</h2>
        <p><strong>When It Was Made:</strong> The <em>New Revised Standard Version (NRSV)</em> was published in 1989 as a revision of the RSV, aiming to update the language for modern readers and incorporate the most recent advances in biblical scholarship and textual criticism.</p>

        <p><strong>Manuscript Sources:</strong> Like the RSV, the NRSV is based on critical editions of the Hebrew and Greek texts, including the Dead Sea Scrolls and other ancient manuscripts. It continues to reflect both the Alexandrian and Byzantine text-types, but with a more inclusive approach to language and a greater emphasis on historical accuracy.</p>

        <p><strong>Significance:</strong> The NRSV is widely regarded as one of the most academically rigorous translations and is commonly used in academic and liturgical settings. It is praised for its inclusive language and careful attention to the original manuscripts.</p>
