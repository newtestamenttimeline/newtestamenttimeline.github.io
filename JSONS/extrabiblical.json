Most of these writings are generally dated later than the canonical books, often in the mid- to late-2nd century, and are considered less reliable regarding authorship. While many are attributed to key figures like Peter, Mary Magdalene, or Barnabas, modern scholars agree that these attributions are unlikely to be authentic, as the actual authors are mostly anonymous or unknown. Unlike the canonical texts, which have earlier and more widespread manuscript support (such as the Codex Sinaiticus and Vaticanus), apocryphal texts often survive in limited manuscripts or fragmented forms, like the Gospel of Thomas from the Nag Hammadi library. These writings were rejected by early church leaders due to theological concerns, particularly their association with Gnosticism or Jewish-Christian sects, and their later dates and less secure transmission further distinguish them from the earlier, more reliably attested New Testament books.",
