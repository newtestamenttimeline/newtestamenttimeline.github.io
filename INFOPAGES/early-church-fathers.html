    Early Church Fathers
</header>

<div class="content">
    <p>The Early Church Fathers were theologians, writers, and leaders in early Christianity who profoundly influenced the development of Christian doctrine, liturgy, and church structure. Their works are critical for understanding early Christian beliefs and practices, as well as the transmission of the New Testament text.</p>

        <div class="father-box">
            <h4>Clement of Rome (Late 1st Century)</h4>
            <p>Author of <em>1 Clement</em>, a letter to the Corinthians. He quotes Old Testament texts and echoes New Testament teachings, emphasizing unity and humility.</p>
            <p><strong>Contribution to Bible Dating:</strong> Clement's references to Paul’s letters and Gospel themes suggest the New Testament books were already widely circulated by the end of the 1st century.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="father-box">
            <h4>Ignatius of Antioch (c. 35–108 CE)</h4>
            <p>Known for seven letters written on his way to martyrdom, Ignatius advocated for church hierarchy and explicitly referenced the divinity and humanity of Christ.</p>
            <p><strong>Contribution to Bible Dating:</strong> Ignatius quotes from the Gospels, particularly Matthew and John, showing they were authoritative and recognized by the early 2nd century.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="father-box">
            <h4>Polycarp of Smyrna (c. 69–155 CE)</h4>
            <p>A disciple of the Apostle John, Polycarp's letter to the Philippians quotes extensively from New Testament texts.</p>
            <p><strong>Contribution to Bible Text:</strong> His references to Pauline letters and the Gospels confirm their early usage and acceptance as Scripture.</p>
