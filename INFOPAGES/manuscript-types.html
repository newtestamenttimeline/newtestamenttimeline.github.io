    <!-- Introduction -->
    <section class="section">
        <h2>Introduction to New Testament Manuscripts</h2>
        <p>New Testament manuscripts are among the most important historical documents in Christianity. Over centuries, these manuscripts were copied by hand, leading to thousands of surviving pieces that tell us much about how the New Testament was transmitted. Scholars classify these manuscripts into several types based on their material, script, dating, and format. In this section, we explore these different types in detail, discussing their provenance, methods of dating, and the significance of major manuscript finds.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Papyrus Manuscripts -->
    <section class="section">
        <h2>Papyrus Manuscripts</h2>
        <p>Papyrus manuscripts are the earliest known New Testament documents, written on papyrus, a plant-based material commonly used in the ancient world. These manuscripts date from the 2nd to the 4th centuries and represent some of the oldest surviving New Testament texts.</p>

        <h3>Dating Methods and Provenance</h3>
        <p>Papyri are typically dated through a combination of paleography (the study of ancient handwriting) and radiocarbon dating. Paleographers analyze the script to estimate the period in which the document was written, while radiocarbon dating is used in rare cases to determine the age of the papyrus material itself. Most of the known New Testament papyri come from Egypt, where the dry climate helped preserve these fragile documents.</p>

        <h3>Major Finds</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>P52 (John Rylands Papyrus):</strong> Discovered in Egypt in 1920, this fragment is considered the earliest surviving piece of the New Testament, dating to around 125 AD. It contains a portion of the Gospel of John.</li>
            <li><strong>Chester Beatty Papyri:</strong> These important manuscripts, discovered in the 1930s in Egypt, contain large portions of the Gospels, Acts, Paul's epistles, and Revelation. They date from the 2nd and 3rd centuries.</li>
            <li><strong>Bodmer Papyri:</strong> Discovered in Egypt in the 1950s, these papyri contain texts from the Gospels of Luke and John, as well as other early Christian writings. They date to the 3rd century.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Significance</h3>
        <p>Papyrus manuscripts are invaluable for textual criticism because they represent the earliest stages of the New Testament's transmission. They provide insight into how the texts were copied and circulated in the early Christian communities, particularly in Egypt. These manuscripts also help scholars trace the development of different textual traditions over time.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Uncial Manuscripts -->
    <section class="section">
        <h2>Uncial Manuscripts</h2>
        <p>Uncial manuscripts are characterized by their use of large, capital letters and were written on parchment (animal skin). They date from the 4th to the 8th centuries and were produced in a more formal style than the earlier papyri.</p>

        <h3>Dating and Provenance</h3>
        <p>Uncial manuscripts are dated using paleographic techniques, which involve comparing the script to other known dated examples. Many uncial manuscripts were produced in the Byzantine Empire, and their large, clear script suggests they were often intended for liturgical use in churches.</p>

        <h3>Major Finds</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Codex Sinaiticus:</strong> One of the most important uncial manuscripts, Codex Sinaiticus contains the oldest complete copy of the New Testament. It was discovered at St. Catherine’s Monastery in Sinai by Constantin von Tischendorf in 1844 and dates to the mid-4th century.</li>
            <li><strong>Codex Vaticanus:</strong> This manuscript, housed in the Vatican Library, is another highly significant 4th-century manuscript. It contains almost the entire New Testament and is considered one of the best-preserved uncial codices.</li>
            <li><strong>Codex Alexandrinus:</strong> Dating to the 5th century, this manuscript is one of the earliest and most complete examples of the Bible in Greek. It was brought to England from Alexandria in 1621.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Significance</h3>
        <p>Uncial manuscripts are critical to New Testament textual criticism because they represent a transitional period in the history of the text. By the time these manuscripts were produced, Christianity had become an established religion in the Roman Empire, and the New Testament had been widely accepted as scripture. The formal script and high quality of these manuscripts suggest they were used in important religious contexts, such as public readings in churches.</p>

    <!-- Minuscule Manuscripts -->
    <section class="section">
        <h2>Minuscule Manuscripts</h2>
        <p>Minuscule manuscripts are written in a cursive script, which became the standard for copying texts in the 9th century and remained in use until the invention of the printing press in the 15th century. These manuscripts are more numerous than uncials and include many of the later copies of the New Testament.</p>

        <h3>Dating and Provenance</h3>
        <p>Minuscule manuscripts are dated based on the style of writing and other contextual clues. They were produced primarily in Byzantine scriptoria, where professional scribes copied texts for religious use. Minuscule manuscripts were often written on parchment or paper, and many of them contain decorative elements, including illuminated initials.</p>

        <h3>Major Finds</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Minuscule 33:</strong> Known as "the queen of the minuscules," this manuscript is highly regarded for its accuracy and dates to the 9th century.</li>
            <li><strong>Minuscule 700:</strong> An 11th-century manuscript that includes all four Gospels and exhibits a mix of Byzantine and Western textual traditions.</li>
            <li><strong>Minuscule 1739:</strong> A 10th-century manuscript of the Pauline Epistles, noted for its textual agreements with much earlier manuscripts, suggesting it was copied from an ancient exemplar.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Significance</h3>
        <p>Minuscule manuscripts offer a glimpse into the continued transmission of the New Testament over the centuries. Although they are later than papyri and uncials, their large numbers and relative consistency provide valuable evidence for the stability of the New Testament text in the medieval period. Many minuscule manuscripts also contain marginal notes, commentary, and other features that provide insight into how these texts were read and used in various Christian communities.</p>

    <!-- Lectionaries -->
    <section class="section">
        <h2>Lectionary Manuscripts</h2>
        <p>Lectionaries are books that contain portions of the New Testament organized according to the church calendar for use in public worship. They became popular from the 6th century onward and were widely used in both Eastern and Western churches.</p>

        <h3>Dating and Provenance</h3>
        <p>Lectionaries are dated using the same paleographic methods as other manuscript types. They were primarily produced in monasteries and churches, where they were used during liturgical services. Many lectionaries were elaborately decorated and written on high-quality parchment, reflecting their importance in the life of the church.</p>

        <h3>Major Finds</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Lectionary 429:</strong> A 10th-century Byzantine lectionary containing readings from the Gospels and Pauline Epistles. It is known for its detailed marginal notes and high-quality script.</li>
            <li><strong>Lectionary 296:</strong> Dating to the 12th century, this manuscript is one of the best-preserved lectionaries from the Byzantine tradition and includes beautiful illuminations.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Significance</h3>
        <p>Lectionaries provide important insights into how the New Testament was used in early Christian worship. By studying these manuscripts, scholars can trace the development of Christian liturgy and see which portions of the New Testament were considered most important for public readings. Additionally, lectionaries help confirm the stability of the New Testament text, as the passages selected for readings often show remarkable consistency across different manuscripts.</p>
