        <h2>Welcome to the New Testament Timeline</h2>
        <p>Welcome to the New Testament Timeline, an interactive and educational resource designed to help you explore the rich history of New Testament manuscripts and the events surrounding them. This site is in Beta and aims to provide detailed insights into manuscripts, historical events, and other related topics. Although the big picture of the timeline is accurate, some specific text copy here and there may be AI generated, we will be going over everything meticulously and when we're done we will update this text.</p>
