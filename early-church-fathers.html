        <h3>How Church Fathers Relate to Manuscripts</h3>
        <p>Church Fathers such as Origen, Irenaeus, and Augustine referenced New Testament texts in their works. These quotations allow scholars to compare them to surviving manuscripts, providing additional layers of evidence for dating manuscripts and determining which variants of the text may have existed in the early centuries.</p>

        <h3>Role in Dating and Authorship of Bible Books</h3>
        <p>The Church Fathers provide some of the earliest non-manuscript evidence for the dating and authorship of the New Testament. Their writings often affirm traditional authorship (such as the Gospels being attributed to Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John) and support the dating of books to the first century.</p>
