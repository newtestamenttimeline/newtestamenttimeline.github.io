    <!-- Gospels Section -->
    <section class="section" id="gospels">
        <h2>Gospels</h2>
        <p>The Gospels are the four accounts of the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ. These texts form the cornerstone of Christian belief and are the first books of the New Testament. The Gospels were written by different authors, each with a unique perspective, but all focus on the ministry and message of Jesus.</p>

        <h3>Synoptic Gospels</h3>
        <p>The first three Gospels—Matthew, Mark, and Luke—are known as the Synoptic Gospels because they share a similar structure and many of the same stories. Scholars believe that the Gospel of Mark was written first, with Matthew and Luke drawing upon it as a source.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Matthew:</strong> The Gospel of Matthew emphasizes Jesus as the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecy. It includes the Sermon on the Mount and is often seen as the most "Jewish" of the Gospels.</li>
            <li><strong>Mark:</strong> The shortest of the Gospels, Mark’s account focuses on the actions and miracles of Jesus. It is fast-paced and often considered the earliest Gospel, written around 65–70 AD.</li>
            <li><strong>Luke:</strong> The Gospel of Luke offers a detailed and orderly account of Jesus' life, with particular attention to his teachings on social justice and care for the marginalized. Luke is also the author of the Acts of the Apostles.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>The Gospel of John</h3>
        <p>The Gospel of John stands apart from the Synoptic Gospels with its emphasis on the divinity of Jesus. It contains more theological reflections, focusing on Jesus as the eternal Word of God. John's Gospel includes the famous "I am" statements and the story of Lazarus's resurrection.</p>

Acts focuses on the work of the apostles, particularly Peter and Paul, as they spread the message of Christianity throughout the Roman Empire. It provides valuable insights into the development of the early church, the spread of the Gospel, and the challenges faced by the first Christian communities.</p>
