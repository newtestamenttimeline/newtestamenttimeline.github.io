    <!-- Manuscript Types Section -->
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Manuscript Types</h2>
        <p>New Testament manuscripts are categorized by their material, style, and date of writing. The earliest manuscripts are written on papyrus, while later manuscripts are on parchment and use different scripts, such as uncial and minuscule. These manuscripts help scholars trace the transmission of the New Testament over centuries.</p>
        
        <div class="manuscript-type">
            <h3>Papyrus</h3>
            <p>Ancient manuscripts written on papyrus, a plant-based material used primarily during the early centuries of the New Testament period. These manuscripts are among the oldest surviving texts of the New Testament.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="manuscript-type">
            <h3>Uncial</h3>
            <p>Uncial manuscripts are written in large, capital letters on parchment. These manuscripts are from the 4th to 8th centuries and are considered some of the most valuable sources of the New Testament.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="manuscript-type">
            <h3>Minuscule</h3>
            <p>Minuscule manuscripts, written in a cursive script, date from the 9th to 15th centuries. These are the most numerous type of New Testament manuscripts, often containing marginal notes and corrections.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="manuscript-type">
            <h3>Lectionary</h3>
            <p>Lectionaries contain portions of the New Testament organized according to the liturgical calendar. These were used in early Christian worship services and are invaluable for understanding how the New Testament was used in early Christian worship.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <!-- Manuscript Families Section -->
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Manuscript Families</h2>
        <p>Manuscript families, or "text-types," are groups of manuscripts that share common textual characteristics and geographical origins. By comparing manuscripts from the same family, scholars can trace the history of textual variations and understand how the New Testament was transmitted in different regions of the early Christian world.</p>
        
        <div class="manuscript-family">
            <h3>Alexandrian Family</h3>
            <p>The Alexandrian family of manuscripts is one of the earliest and most reliable sources of the New Testament. These manuscripts are often associated with Alexandria, Egypt, a major center of early Christian scholarship.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="manuscript-family">
            <h3>Byzantine Family</h3>
            <p>The Byzantine family represents the majority of surviving New Testament manuscripts. Originating in the Byzantine Empire, these texts became the standard version of the New Testament in Greek-speaking churches.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="manuscript-family">
            <h3>Western Family</h3>
            <p>The Western family of manuscripts, associated with the Western Roman Empire, often exhibits paraphrasing and additional textual variation compared to the Alexandrian and Byzantine families.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="manuscript-family">
            <h3>Caesarean Family</h3>
            <p>This family of manuscripts is believed to have originated in Caesarea in the 3rd or 4th century. It is known for blending features of both the Alexandrian and Western text-types.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <!-- Geographic Regions Section -->
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Geographic Regions</h2>
        <p>The geographic regions where New Testament manuscripts were produced played a crucial role in the development of different manuscript families and text-types. Major centers such as Alexandria, Byzantium, and Rome were home to scribes who copied and transmitted the texts of the New Testament.</p>
        
        <div class="geography">
            <h3>Alexandria</h3>
            <p>Alexandria, Egypt, was a significant center of early Christian learning and the origin of many of the oldest and most reliable New Testament manuscripts.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="geography">
            <h3>Byzantium</h3>
            <p>Byzantium (later Constantinople) was a major hub for the production of New Testament manuscripts, particularly during the Byzantine period. The Byzantine text-type is the most widely copied and distributed.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="geography">
            <h3>Rome</h3>
            <p>Rome, as the center of the Western Roman Empire, played a key role in the dissemination of the Western text-type, known for its unique variations in the New Testament text.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <!-- Early Church Fathers Section -->
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Early Church Fathers</h2>
        <p>The Early Church Fathers were theologians and writers who played a key role in the development of early Christian doctrine. Their writings provide valuable insight into how the New Testament was interpreted, transmitted, and used in the early centuries of Christianity. By quoting and referencing New Testament texts, they help scholars understand the history and authorship of the New Testament books.</p>
        
        <div class="church-fathers">
            <h3>Significance of the Early Church Fathers</h3>
            <p>The Early Church Fathers were key theologians and writers in early Christianity who helped shape the Christian tradition. They are significant to biblical studies because they frequently cited New Testament texts in their writings, often quoting them verbatim. These citations help scholars establish the authenticity and dating of New Testament books.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="church-fathers">
            <h3>How Church Fathers Relate to Manuscripts</h3>
            <p>Church Fathers such as Origen, Irenaeus, and Augustine referenced New Testament texts in their works. These quotations allow scholars to compare them to surviving manuscripts, providing additional layers of evidence for dating manuscripts and determining which variants of the text may have existed in the early centuries.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="church-fathers">
            <h3>Role in Dating and Authorship of Bible Books</h3>
            <p>The Church Fathers provide some of the earliest non-manuscript evidence for the dating and authorship of the New Testament. Their writings often affirm traditional authorship (such as the Gospels being attributed to Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John) and support the dating of books to the first century.</p>
